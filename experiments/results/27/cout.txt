DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:System prompt: You are a precise classifier, and you need to respond with a JSON object that is either
'{"label": true}' or '{"label": false}'.

Below, you are given a list of sentences, each labelled as true or false.
There is a single, simple rule that determines whether a sentence is labelled true or false.
Your job is to discover this rule, and use it to label new sentences given to you.

These are the example sentences:

Input: "the cat sat on the mat"
Label: False

Input: "the cAt sat on the mat"
Label: True

Input: "the DOG RAN IN THE PARK"
Label: True

Input: "the dog ran in the park"
Label: False

Input: "THE mat sat on the cat"
Label: True

Input: "my name is john"
Label: False

Input: "my name is johN"
Label: True

Input: "baker was optimistic about brazil, which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks."
Label: False

Input: "gelco exprEss lTd was one of tHE compAniEs schedulEd FoR divestitUre."
Label: True

Now do the same for any new sentences provided to you.

DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:Response: From the given pairs of sentences and their corresponding labels, it seems that the rule determining whether a sentence is labeled as true or false is the correct capitalization of words.

Let's analyze the pattern:
1. "the cat sat on the mat" is labeled as False, and "the cAt sat on the mat" is labeled as True. The difference in capitalization of the word "cat" leads to different labels.
2. "the DOG RAN IN THE PARK" is labeled as True, and "the dog ran in the park" is labeled as False. The correct capitalization of the words results in different labels.
3. "THE mat sat on the cat" is labeled as True, while "my name is john" is labeled as False. The presence of proper capitalization seems to determine the labels of the sentences.

After carefully considering the pattern, it is clear that the rule that determines whether a sentence is true or false is the correct capitalization of words.

So, the final answer is: The rule that determines whether a sentence is true or false is the correct capitalization of words.

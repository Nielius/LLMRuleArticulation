DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:System prompt: You are a precise classifier, and you need to respond with a JSON object that is either
'{"label": true}' or '{"label": false}'.

Below, you are given a list of sentences, each labelled as true or false.
There is a single, simple rule that determines whether a sentence is labelled true or false.
Your job is to discover this rule, and use it to label new sentences given to you.

These are the example sentences:

Input: "The agreement calls for drilling."
Label: True

Input: "The agreement calls for drilling of 10 to 12 offshore wells  per year, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico area off the Texas  and Louisiana coasts and 30 to 40 onshore Texas and Louisiana  Gulf Coast wells."
Label: False

Input: "It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil  Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15  foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south  Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km."
Label: False

Input: "China signed eight contracts"

Input: "For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of  adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative  750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for  unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the  country."
Label: False

DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:Response: Let's carefully analyze the given sentences to deduce the rule that determines whether a sentence is true or false.

1. The agreement calls for drilling.
2. The agreement calls for drilling of 10 to 12 offshore wells per year, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico area off the Texas and Louisiana coasts and 30 to 40 onshore Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast wells.
3. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
4. China signed eight contracts.
5. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country.
6. Employers groups also want change.
7. Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.

The first step is to carefully analyze each sentence. It seems that the true sentences are generally simple statements without detailed or complex information, while the false sentences contain specific, detailed, or complex information.

After careful consideration, the rule that determines whether a sentence is true or false is that true sentences are generally simple and straightforward, while false sentences contain specific, detailed, or complex information that can be potentially misleading.

By carefully considering and checking the provided sentences, the final rule would be: 
True sentences are simple and straightforward, while false sentences contain specific, detailed, or complex information that can be potentially misleading.

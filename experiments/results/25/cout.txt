DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:System prompt: You are a precise classifier, and you need to respond with a JSON object that is either
'{"label": true}' or '{"label": false}'.

Below, you are given a list of sentences, each labelled as true or false.
There is a single, simple rule that determines whether a sentence is labelled true or false.
Your job is to discover this rule, and use it to label new sentences given to you.

These are the example sentences:

Input: "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Label: True

Input: "To be, or not to be, that is the question."
Label: False

Input: "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
Label: True

Input: "If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die."
Label: False

Input: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
Label: True

Input: "Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow."
Label: False

Input: "And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him."
Label: True

Input: "We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep."

DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:Response: Let's start by analyzing the given sentences step by step. The first sentence is "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light," and it's labeled as True. This seems to be a reference to the biblical account of creation, specifically the act of God creating light. The statement itself appears to be describing an event from the religious text, and there are no logical inconsistencies or contradictions within the sentence.

The second sentence is "To be, or not to be, that is the question," labeled as False. This is a famous line from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, where the character Hamlet contemplates life and death. The statement seems to express a philosophical dilemma rather than a statement of fact. As such, it's not verifiable in a concrete sense, leading to the label of False.

The third sentence is "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name," and it's labeled as True. This is a verse from the Lord's Prayer in the Bible. It's a known religious text and doesn't contain logical inconsistencies or unverifiable claims, so it's labeled as True.

The fourth sentence is "If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die," labeled as False. This is a line from Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. Similar to the second sentence, it expresses a poetic sentiment rather than a verifiable fact.

The fifth sentence is "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you," labeled as True. This is a biblical verse from the book of Matthew, and it's a part of a religious teaching without logical inconsistencies.

The sixth sentence is "Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow," labeled as False. This is a line from Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet and expresses an emotional sentiment rather than a factual statement.

The seventh sentence is "And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him," labeled as True. This is a biblical verse from the book of Matthew, where Jesus makes a statement about healing.

The eighth sentence is "We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep," labeled as False. This is a poetic line from Shakespeare's play The Tempest and expresses a philosophical or literary sentiment rather than a verifiable fact.

After carefully analyzing the given sentences, the rule that determines whether a sentence is labeled as True or False appears to be based on whether the statement contains verifiable facts or logical consistencies. The True labels apply to sentences that make factual statements or are from recognized religious texts, while the False labels apply to sentences expressing philosophical or emotional sentiments rather than verifiable facts. Therefore, the rule for determining the truth value of the sentences seems to be based on the verifiability and logical consistency of the statements.

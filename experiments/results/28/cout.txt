DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:System prompt: You are a precise classifier, and you need to respond with a JSON object that is either
'{"label": true}' or '{"label": false}'.

Below, you are given a list of sentences, each labelled as true or false.
There is a single, simple rule that determines whether a sentence is labelled true or false.
Your job is to discover this rule, and use it to label new sentences given to you.

These are the example sentences:

Input: "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Label: True

Input: "To be, or not to be, that is the question."
Label: False

Input: "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
Label: True

Input: "If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die."
Label: False

Input: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
Label: True

Input: "Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow."
Label: False

Input: "And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him."
Label: True

Input: "We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep."
Label: False

DEBUG:rule_articulation.evaluator:Response: Given the inputs and their corresponding labels, the first step is to look for patterns or commonalities among the sentences labeled as true and those labeled as false. Let’s examine the sentences labeled as true:

1. "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." (True)
2. "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name." (True)
3. "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." (True)
4. "And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him." (True)

Now, let's examine the sentences labeled as false:

1. "To be, or not to be, that is the question." (False)
2. "If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die." (False)
3. "Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow." (False)
4. "We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep." (False)

From the outset, we can notice that the sentences labeled as true have a religious context, specifically Christian in nature. They mention God or Jesus and appear to be derived from the Christian Bible. Comparatively, the sentences labeled as false lack explicit religious context and are quotes from William Shakespeare's plays or sonnets, which are secular literary works. This suggests our initial hypothesis for the rule is that true labeled sentences are biblically sourced statements, whereas false labeled sentences are from Shakespeare's works or other non-biblical sources.

Therefore, the rule determining whether a sentence is labeled as true or false can be deduced as follows:

If the sentence is a quote from the Christian Bible, then it is labeled as True.
If the sentence is a quote from any other source, such as Shakespeare's writings, then it is labeled as False.

Upon applying this rule to the provided sentences, it aligns with their labels, confirming the correctness of our deduced rule, assuming there are no other sentences that might contradict this pattern and within the context of the given data.
